The patient came in at around 11:00AM today. They were seen around 11:30 AM. Their primary complaint was ongoing issues with their memory. 
They have been seeing their PCP at MGH for 10 years. Their primary care physician noted about a year ago that the patient's memory was declining. 
They ran a cognitive test but did not find evidence of dementia. They have no family history of Alzheimer's. They called after their visit at 
3  PM, requesting a refill for their Metformin. 

Lab values: 
HBA1c 9.0
TUC 204
ABCDKFKS 3 

It is recommended that the patient see a neurologist, as they have not done so yet. The subject denies MCI but it appears like they 
may have early stage dementia. The patient will continue their metformin and check back in with me in six weeks.
